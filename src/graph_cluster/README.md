# Graph Cluster

Experiement different graph clustering methodologies. The followings are to be implemented:

- Asset Graph (AG)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Planar Maximally Filtered Graph (PMFG)
- Random Matrix Theory (directly obtain communities without building a graph)

Alternatively each of the first three could be built upon correlation matrices transformed using techniques covered in RMT.
